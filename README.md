ThatMovieWatchList
==================

## A bit of context

ThatMovieWatchList is a small project that will be graded by my PHP teacher, and will make me practice PHP.

The instructions were :
* The project shall to be in PHP and use PDO to communicate with a database
* It shall be in a GitHub repo
* The Readme.md shall show the differents steps of what I do, including dead-ends and mistakes.
   * It can include screnshots, by exemple of the model of the website, of some step of creating the databases  
   * The order of realization of the different parts of the application

* It shall show the issues encountered :
   * What I wanted to do in the first place, the issue encountered, how I reacted to it  
   * It can include snippets of code (but no code commentaries) and/or links to pages/articles with code I wanted to use, and explanations on what I replaced it with.

* Commit should be as regular as possible

* New branches should be made to test the implementation of new features.

## What is ThatMovieWatchList supposed to do ?

### Project synopsis :

Create a simple web app that allows users to :
1. Register/Log In
2. Add movies to a list of those they want to see
3. Add movies to a list of those they have already seen

The database will contain information about the films, the directors and the actors.

There will be a search engine that allows you to search for films by title, style, director, or actor.

There won't be any admin within the project (at least in this first version), data will be handeln with PhpMyAdmin.

Option : Import CSV

## Stages of the project realization

### Working on the database's architecture

Using the MERISE method to create a structure consistent with the project.


### Finding a name for the web app

First thing I thought of was "MyMovieList", but of course lots of people already had that idea. I found many small app specially on android/apple phones with this name.

Then I thought about "MovieWatchList" or "MyMovieWatchList", but then again, not that original.

I finally settled with "ThatMovieWatchList" - a name a little more sought after - referring to 'That 70's show' (and I didn't want to spend much more time on it).

This done, repo created here, then initiated locally via GitBash and created this README.md you're reading, then pushed it in the remote repo.

### Started organizing the project, using Separation of concerns

- created layout folder with reusable parts for the different web pages : header, footer, and a navbar, using php's file inclusion (require and require_once)

- added a background image I made to all pages under construction in order to protect my eyes from white screens ^^'cd 

- also, found a font I could use in logo, similar to that 70's show iconic font. Kept it out of versionning for now.

### Recreated an authentification from the exercise I made a few days earlier.
